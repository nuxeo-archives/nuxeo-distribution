# About the Nuxeo Distribution module

See <http://doc.nuxeo.org/> for full documentation.

This module builds, packages and tests the Nuxeo products.

## Requirements

Building Nuxeo products requires the following tools:
  * JDK 6 (Java Sun recommended)
  * Apache Maven 2.2.1
  * Apache Ant 1.7.1+
  * Open Source tools that will be downloaded by Maven when needed.

## Usage

### Build with Maven (recommended)

Java and Maven are at the lowest level, all configuration about building a module
is given in the Maven POM file. So, everything can be built using Maven but it
requires some knowledge about Nuxeo and its packagings.

Maven usage: `mvn clean package [-P<comma separated profiles>]`

#### Examples

 * (default) Building all Nuxeo products and their alternatives:

        mvn clean package
        mvn clean package -Pall-distributions

 * All JBoss packages:

        mvn clean package -Pjboss

 * All Tomcat packages:

        mvn clean package -Ptomcat

### Build with Ant

Ant is available at the top level: Ant targets have been defined to provide
user-friendly commands for most used build cases.

Ant usage: `ant distrib [-Ddistrib=profile]`

#### Examples

        ant distrib
        ant distrib -Ddistrib=nuxeo-dm
        ant distrib -Ddistrib=tomcat

## Understanding Maven profiles and classifiers

Profiles are mainly used to manage the list of classifiers being generated.
Maven plugins rely by default on a such mechanism for creating tests, sources and
javadoc jars. It is usable also for any other specific builds (OS, JDK, env, packaging, ...).
It's widely used by a lot of third-parties (google gwt, json, shindings, ...).
Think about "classifiers" as "qualifiers" (sources, javadoc, tests, linux, windows,
mac, jta, all, ...). For example, the following are two alternatives ("classifiers")
for the package ("artifact") named "nuxeo-distribution-tomcat":
  * nuxeo-distribution-tomcat-5.4.0-SNAPSHOT-nuxeo-dm-jtajca.zip
  * nuxeo-distribution-tomcat-5.4.0-SNAPSHOT-nuxeo-dm.zip

Some profiles are used to choose the product to build. Other profiles are used to
choose which alternatives (classifiers) of the product will be built. Multiple
profiles can be used simultaneously.
Here are some common profiles and their impact on build result:
  * all-distributions: build everything except the Windows installer
  * all: build all classifiers for the called module(s)
  * nuxeo-cap: build only Nuxeo CAP classifier (if JBoss module, so build only
    JBoss with Nuxeo CAP)
  * nuxeo-dm: same as nuxeo-cap but with Nuxeo DM
  * shell: package a Nuxeo Shell
  * jboss: package a Nuxeo within JBoss

Here are some usage examples (ran from nuxeo-distribution):
  * (default) Building Nuxeo CAP, nuxeo DM with VCS, JBoss with Nuxeo DM on VCS
    o mvn clean install
    o mvn clean install -Pjboss,nuxeo-dm,vcs
  * Building all Nuxeo DM alternatives
    o mvn clean install -Pnuxeo-dm,all
  * Building all JBoss packagings
    o mvn clean install -Pjboss,all
  * Building all Nuxeo products and their alternatives
    o mvn clean install -Pall-distributions

Note: because of a Maven bug making things crazy when two classifiers of an
artifact are not deployed at the same time (i.e. if you deploy only nuxeo-cap
classifier of nuxeo-distribution-jboss, then nuxeo-dm classifier becomes
unreachable from local and remote Maven repositories).
That means when you want to "deploy" (Maven remote deployment) or "install" (Maven
local deployment) a module, you must use "all" profile.

When you need only one classifier, for any other purpose than
install/deploy to m2 repository, then you can use the dedicated profiles.


## Details about predefined applications

### Nuxeo Core Server

A minimal server EAR. An embedded repository will be started. No other  platform services are available.

This application can be used to debug, test or develop nuxeo components that need a repository connection.

Remoting will be also available in the future via Nuxeo Runtime.

Built EAR is in `nuxeo-distribution-coreserver/target/`.

It is available within Tomcat in `nuxeo-distribution-tomcat/target/`.


### Nuxeo CAP

Basic document management features.

Built EAR is in `nuxeo-distribution-cap/target/`.

This is the default available application in `nuxeo-distribution-tomcat/target/`.

### Nuxeo Document Management

Advanced document management features.

Built EAR is in `nuxeo-distribution-dm/target/`.

It is installable in the default available application in `nuxeo-distribution-tomcat/target/` when running the wizard and selecting DM (for users), or by activating the "nuxeo-dm" preset (for developers).

### Nuxeo Digital Assets Management

Multimedia document collection management features.

Based on the addon <https://github.com/nuxeo/nuxeo-dam>.

Built EAR is in `nuxeo-distribution-dam/target/`.

It is installable in the default available application in `nuxeo-distribution-tomcat/target/` when running the wizard and selecting DAM (for users), or by activating the "nuxeo-dam" preset (for developers).

### Nuxeo Social Collaboration

Social network features (social workspaces, user relationships, mini-messages, user activity stream, ...).

Based on the addon <https://github.com/nuxeo/nuxeo-social-collaboration>.

Built EAR is in `nuxeo-distribution-social-collaboration/target/`.

It is installable in the default available application in `nuxeo-distribution-tomcat/target/` when running the wizard and selecting SC (for users), or by activating the "nuxeo-sc" preset (for developers).

### Nuxeo Case Management

Case Management features (management of documents composed of items that evolve by being transfered to different persons responsible for their review or approval. A case can be for instance: a loan case composed of the different documents required for loan processing; a mail envelope with one or several documents; a legal case, etc.).

Based on the addon <https://github.com/nuxeo/nuxeo-cmf>.

Built EAR is in `nuxeo-distribution-cmf/target/`.

It is installable in the default available application in `nuxeo-distribution-tomcat/target/` when running the wizard and selecting CMF (for users), or by activating the "nuxeo-cmf" preset (for developers).


### Other applications

There are a lot of other useful addons (see <https://github.com/nuxeo/>) and applications available from the [Nuxeo Marketplace](http://marketplace.nuxeo.com/).

Addons are manually built and deployed on the target server.

Marketplace applications are installable from the Admin Center within the Nuxeo server.

## Custom build

It is of course possible to create custom builds/assemblies.

For historical reasons, there are multiple technologies used for packaging in
nuxeo-distribution project ([maven-assembly-plugin](http://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-assembly-plugin/), [maven-nuxeo-plugin](http://hg.nuxeo.org/tools/maven-nuxeo-plugin/), [maven-antrun-extended-plugin](http://java.net/projects/maven-antrun-extended-plugin), [nuxeo-distribution-tools](http://hg.nuxeo.org/tools/nuxeo-distribution-tools/)).

They are all based on Maven principles with the objectives to avoid duplication,
ease maintenance and upgrade, rely on Maven artifacts, be OS independent.

We recommend to use our newest tool [nuxeo-distribution-tools](http://doc.nuxeo.com/x/BIAO).

Execution of the assembly may be done from Maven execution as a Maven plugin,
from command line or from Ant.

Based on Ant syntax, it provides access to major Maven concepts and Ant flexibility.

Principles of an assembly are generally to:

  * inherit a Maven dependency tree (list of artifacts to retrieve)
  * use this dependency tree to dispatch artifacts into directories
  * download complementary artifacts (default packaging, resources, drivers, ...)
  * download an empty server (JBoss, Jetty, Tomcat, ...)
  * assemble all those parts into a runnable product.

See the chosen tool [documentation](http://doc.nuxeo.com) for more details.
